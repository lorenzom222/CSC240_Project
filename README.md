## GOAL
The goal of performing k-means clustering on this dataset of prison statistics from 2010 is to group the states of the US into clusters based on similarities in their prison statistics. The dataset contains information on the incarceration rates for different racial and ethnic groups, as well as the total population and incarceration rate for each state. By clustering the states based on these features, you can identify patterns and relationships between different states and gain insights into the characteristics of each cluster. This can help you make predictions about the prison statistics of each state based on the cluster it belongs to. For example, if one cluster is characterized by high incarceration rates among certain racial or ethnic groups, you might predict that states belonging to this cluster will have similar characteristics. 


The goal of this report is to analyze and compare the rates of incarceration in the United States by race and ethnicity, using correctional data for adults aged 18 and over. The report will use comparable data for the entire country, covering all ages, to provide a comprehensive overview of the issue. The analysis will be based on incarceration rates per 100,000 people, as well as a breakdown of the data by race and ethnicity. This will include data on the total number of individuals in correctional facilities, as well as the number of white, black or African American, American Indian and Alaska Native, Asian, Native Hawaiian and other Pacific Islander, and individuals of some other race or two or more races. The report will also examine the Hispanic or Latino population, as well as the white alone, not Hispanic or Latino population. The analysis will cover both male and female populations, and will provide a comprehensive overview of the incarceration rates by race and ethnicity in the United States. The report aims to provide valuable insights into this complex issue and to support efforts to address racial and ethnic disparities in the US criminal justice system.
